Before Submitting Assignments:

Here is the Explanation for the Project:

Create Base class "Item" --> remember this class has to be abstract class
"public abstract class Item"
Create private properties _title, _publisher and _publicationYear --> remember the naming convention for private properties
Create public properties that can access above private properties --> example is in week 3
In each public properties there has to be a validation check for title, publisher and publicationYear
  	For Title
  	1: check for Null
  	2: check for length e.g. title should not be "T" single character, at least title should be 5 character long
  	3: should begin with Capital Letter like (The Great Gatsby) not (the great gatsby) --> little bit tricky but you can easily find the way to validate this

  	For Publisher
	1: check for Null
  	2: check for length e.g. publisher should not be "T" single character, at least publisher should be 6 character long
  	3: should begin with Capital Letter like (The Great Gatsby) not (Hachette Book Group) --> little bit tricky but you can easily find the way to validate this

	For PublicationYear
	1: check for Null
	2: check for length e.g. publicationYear should not be 202 but should be 1991, 1995, 2005 i.e. should be of length 4, not less not more


since the Item class is abstract, to follow abstract class structure, create one method which can be used by both Book and Magazine class

e.g. 	public virtual void DisplayItems() // this function can be override
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"Title: {Title}, Publisher: {Publisher}, Year: {PublicationYear}");
	}


Create Another class which is called child class or derived class "Book" and "Magazine"
These class has to Inherit Base class
Example: 
 "public class Book : Item" 
and Book must have its own private property _author
and Magizine must have its own private property _issueNumber
similar to Item class create Public properties that can access _author and _issueNumber

Validation is required for Author and IssueNumber as well
add similar kind of validation as above mentioned





Now, Remember the service layer that I have shown you, which is not mandatory to implement in this project but if you implement than it would be vary nice

Create class LibraryService
This class act as a service layer which perform operation for both Book and Magazine
	create a private List<Item> _items=new List<Item>(); // this store both the objects of book and magazine
	create AddItem(Item item) and DisplayItems() functions within this service
	
you can check duplicateItem and validate within AddItem() function

How to do?
	use foreach or for loop to loop through the list
	using if statement check of Title, Publisher and PublicationYear if all of them matches then



here is a sample code for this service layer

//Its a service layer to manage library items
public class LibraryService
{
    
    private List<Item> _items = new();

    //Method to add item to the library
    public void AddItem(Item item)
    {
        foreach( var existingItem in _items)
        {
            if(existingItem.Title == item.Title &&
               existingItem.Publisher == item.Publisher &&
               existingItem.PublicationYear == item.PublicationYear)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Item already exists in the library.");
            }
            else
            {
                _items.Add(item);
                Console.WriteLine($"Item with these information Title:{item.Title} - Publisher:{item.Publisher} - Publication Year: {item.PublicationYear} added successfully.");
            }
        }
    }

    public void DisplayAllItems()
    {
        foreach (var item in _items)
        {
            item.DisplayInfo();
        }
    }

}


 Creating Exception Classes for better exception handling (Custom Exception)
 you can get example from week3 folder for creating custom exception 


Note  we need to start learning folder structure as well
"Create Folder -> 'Model' -> add all above mentioned classes Item, Book and Magazine here"
"Create Folder -> 'Service' -> add this LibraryService here"
"Create Folder -> 'CustomException' -> add all the customer exception like InvalidItemDataException and DuplicateEntryException" here
